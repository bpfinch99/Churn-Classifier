# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

## Introduction:
In this project, I wanted to develop a machine learning model in order to predict customer churn for a business. Customer churn is when a customer discontinues their service with a company. If a company can accuractely identify customers who are likely to churn, businesses can then take measures to retain them.

## Project Steps:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
  * Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights to the data
  * Handle missing values
  * Transform feature variables
  * Perform SMOTE to deal with data imbalance; do not add data to the test set
2. Model Selection and Training:
  * Select multiple machine learning models capable of binary classification
  * Split data into train and testing
  * Train the model on the training data that has been increased with SMOTE
3. Model Evaluation and Comparison:
  * Evaluate and compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide businesses with a tool for predicting customer churn using machine learning. Using historical customer data and employing machine learning algorithms, the tool will assist in identifying customers who are likely to churn.
